Please note that you still need to go through the formal application process (https://cee.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate).
About the PI
Prior to (re)joining the CEE at UIUC as an Assistant Professor, Ran completed postdoctoral research at Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC, 2023-24) and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST, 2021-2023), received his PhD (2015-2020) and MS (2013-2015) from UIUC, and BS from Peking University in China (2009-2013). The current research interests lie at the intersection of microbiology and environmental engineering, including the microbial ecology of biomass degradation in engineered and natural environments, the evolution of microbial functions relevant to ancient and modern Earth, and microbiome-informed optimization of anaerobic digestion.
About CEE and UIUC
UIUC is a world leader in research, teaching, and public engagement, ranked at #12 among public universities in the US. The CEE department enjoys an outstanding reputation for excellence in undergraduate and graduate education, and for research that improves the quality of life in our nation and around the world. The Environmental Engineering Undergraduate and Graduate Program ranked at #5 and #4, respectively. The Urbana-Champaign twin cities, which "sandwich" the University campus, are 2-3 hour drive to three major metropolitan centers – Chicago, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. Students are encouraged to learn more about the department at https://cee.illinois.edu/ and the university at https://illinois.edu/. The research group, department, and university acknowledge equal access/equal opportunity and welcome individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and ideas who also embrace and value diversity and inclusivity.
