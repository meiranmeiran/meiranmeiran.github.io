  <p align="justify">Welcome to the <b>Mei</b> Research Group working at the <b>M</b>icrobiome-<b>E</b>nvironment <b>I</b>nterface! We will start in Fall 2024 in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our group will study basic science (i.e., microbial diversity, physiology, and ecology) and apply the knowledge to engineered water systems (e.g., wastewater treatment), with the aim to develop microbiology-informed engineering strategies that improve the system performance and reduce the effects of various waste streams on the environment. To achieve our goals, we integrate bioinformatics, microbiology (e.g., microbial cultivation), and engineering principles. Learn more about our research <a href="/research/">here</a>.
  <p align="justify"><b>Diversity</b> is essential in the microbial world we research - often microbes with varied traits cooperate to accomplish a metabolic task that would be impossible individually. Drawing a parallel, the diversity of human society, and our recognition of it, serves as a foundation for innovative ideas and creative accomplishments. We value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and support students and researchers of all backgrounds and identities.</p>
