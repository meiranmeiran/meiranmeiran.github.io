  <p align="justify">Welcome to the Mei Research Group working at the <b>M</b>icrobiome-<b>E</b>nvironment <b>I</b>nterface! We are in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We study microbial diversity in various engineered and natural water systems, and leverage the metabolic capabilities to enhance the sustainability of those systems. To achieve our goals, we integrate genomics, microbial evolution, microbial ecology, and engineering principles. You can learn more about our research <a href="/research/">here</a>.
  <p align="justify">Diversity is essential in the microbial world we research - often microbes with varied traits cooperate to accomplish a metabolic task that would be impossible individually. The diversity of human society, and our recognition of it, serves as a foundation for innovative ideas and creative accomplishments. Our group value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and support students and researchers of all backgrounds and identities.</p>
