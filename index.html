  <p align="justify">Welcome to the <b>Mei</b> Research Group working at the <b><b>M</b></b>icrobiome-<b><b>E</b></b>nvironment <b><b>I</b></b>nterface! We investigate fundamental aspects of microbial diversity, physiology, and ecology, applying this knowledge to engineered water systems, such as wastewater treatment. Our goal is to develop microbiology-informed engineering strategies that enhance system performance and mitigate the environmental impact of various waste streams. To achieve our objectives, we integrate bioinformatics, microbiology — including microbial cultivation — and engineering principles. Learn more about our research <a href="/research/">here</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <p align="justify"><b>Diversity</b> is essential in the microbial world we research - often microbes with varied traits cooperate to accomplish a metabolic task that would be impossible individually. Drawing a parallel, the diversity of human society, and our recognition of it, serves as a foundation for innovative ideas and creative accomplishments. We value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and support students and researchers of all backgrounds and identities.</p>
